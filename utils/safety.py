def is_reply_grounded(reply_text: str, similar_items: List[Dict], must_match: bool = False) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether an assistant's reply is grounded in known listings.

    This function checks if the reply text references any of the listings provided
    in `similar_items`, either by address or external ID. It also considers certain
    phrases (e.g., clarifying questions) as safe by default.

    Args:
        reply_text (str): The full text of the assistant's response.
        similar_items (List[Dict]): A list of known listings, each with a 'payload'
            containing at least 'external_id' and 'address'.
        must_match (bool, optional): If True, the reply must explicitly reference at
            least one known listing to be considered valid. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the reply is grounded in known data or is safely neutral;
              False if it appears to hallucinate listings.
